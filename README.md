# STEALTH_TRACE model
This is a novel prediction model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence in SLD (steatotic liver disease) patients was developed using machine learning algorithms. 

Enter the following fields and click the "Submit" bottun.
1. age
2. Body mass index (height [cm] and body weight [kg])
3. Platelet count (×10^4/µL)
4. AST level (IU/L)
5. ALT level (IU/L)
6. Serum albumin level (g/dL)
7. γ-GTP level (IU/L)

Then the prediction trajectories for the development of HCC for each patient, as predicted by the machine learning model (STEALTH-TRACE model), is displayed individually. 
This model, using seven commonly measured parameters could provide a personalized surveillance system.
